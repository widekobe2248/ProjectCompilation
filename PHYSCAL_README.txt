PhysCal was a personal project to be developed for iPHones and iPads to be used by students and professionals
alike to solve physics equations. It was to have a paid and free version with ads relevant within the free one
to generate revenue. Have not had access to Xcode so the project has been put on pause as of late but want to
finish it eventually.
